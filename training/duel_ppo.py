"""PPO on the duel curriculum: the real game, win/loss only.

The reward carries no information until the round is over, so the network's
whole job is to read a 1010-dimension observation and the critic's whole job is
to predict an outcome this project's own ablations found barely predictable
(learned `V(s)` scored R^2 near zero six times). Three consequences shape the
configuration below, and each of them is a scar:

* **A learning-rate schedule is mandatory.** A constant rate ran to 60M steps
  once and collapsed irreversibly at around 2M, never recovering.
* **The critic gets a head start.** Updating a policy against a value function
  that has not fitted yet is the classic way to diverge, and a sparse terminal
  reward makes the critic the slow half by construction.
* **Entropy decays with the rate rather than staying put.** Nothing rewards
  exploration here except finding a win, so the search has to stay wide for
  much longer than a shaped curriculum needs.

Checkpoints are published every `--save-every` steps for the viewer to pick up,
so the honest read of progress is watching it play rather than reading a curve.

    """A small CNN over the maze, a shared encoder over the bullets, an MLP
    over everything else, and three residual gates on top of the actor.

    The bullet rows arrive in engine creation order, which shifts as rounds are
    fired and expire. Feeding that to a dense layer would make the policy
    sensitive to storage order, so the rows go through one shared encoder and
    are pooled with a mask.

    The gates are the part that is not obvious. Three quantities the engine has
    already computed are wired to the logits directly rather than left for the
    trunk to rediscover:

      * `score::dodge_safety`'s per-movement survival outlook, added to each
        movement's pair of logits;
      * a fire bias built from ammo, the predicted-hit and predicted-suicide
        flags, and the shot's time of flight;
      * a penalty on the two fully-neutral actions that grows with the idle
        streak.

    The first two are scaled by `alpha_old + delta(features)`: a warm-started
    constant the run inherits, plus a correction the trunk can steer per frame.
    Passing `dodge_gate=False` / `ammo_gate=False` gives the older flat-scalar
    form instead, which is what checkpoints before v17 were trained with.

    None of this was published. It is reconstructed from what the browser
    ships — see `training/hybrid_web.py` for how, and
    `training/tests/test_hybrid_web.py` for the check that it reproduces the
    deployed model's logits.
