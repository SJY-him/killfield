//! Observation for the duel curriculum: everything a player could work out,
//! and nothing they could not.
//!
//! The range curriculum spent 100 dimensions and deliberately withheld the
//! maze, on the strength of one bad experiment with a CNN map head. This one
//! goes the other way, because the reward went the other way: with nothing but
//! a win/loss at the end there is no shaping term left to carry information,
//! so the information has to be in here. That matches the project's own record
//! anyway — two observation channels bought more than the entire reward-shaping
//! phase did.
//!
//! # The line
//!
//! **Facts about the world, never answers about the decision.** Concretely,
//! four things are refused:
//!
//! * **Seed and RNG state.** Not available at deployment; a policy that used
//!   them would not survive leaving the trainer.
//! * **The opponent's internal goal stack.** Laika's `Goal`, the planner's
//!   commitments. Opponent-specific, so it evaporates when the opponent
//!   changes, and a policy leaning on it never learned to read the board.
//! * **The opponent's current buttons.** These look observable — the planner's
//!   `L1` model reads them — but that is a same-frame privileged peek. A human
//!   sees motion, not keystrokes, so motion is what goes in: velocity and
//!   angular velocity, differenced from where things were last frame.
//! * **A turret sweep.** `check_bullet_path` accepts any angle, so scanning 36
//!   of them is mechanically trivial and would hand over the best firing
//!   angle. Only the *current* angle is probed, for both tanks. Finding a
//!   firing position still has to be learned by turning.
//!
//! What is given freely is any deterministic function of what is on screen:
//! wall layout, BFS distances, dead ends, the ballistics of bullets already in
//! flight. Precomputing those is not cheating; they are consequences of the
//! visible state, and a good player computes them too.
//!
//! # The two approximations, stated
//!
//! Both aim assist and the per-bullet forecast simulate forward assuming the
//! tanks hold still. Bullets only interact with walls, so the geometry is
//! exact; what is approximate is that a target can move out of the way. The
//! channels answer "where does this go if nobody moves", not "what will
//! happen".
