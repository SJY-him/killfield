//! Port of `killfield/src/killfield/sandbox.js` (and `mirror.js`).
//!
//! The planner needs to roll the world forward without touching it, and
//! without cheating. So the sandbox shares everything a player could see on
//! screen — the maze, wall geometry, distance maps, both poses, every bullet —
//! copies the mutable state, and scrubs the two things that would be hidden
//! knowledge:
//!
//!   - the real random stream is replaced with an independently seeded one
//!   - the opponent's controller is rebuilt from scratch, so its internal goal
//!     stack does not leak across
//!
//! Two opponent models:
//!   L2  runs the scripted AI's algorithm with fresh state. White-box knowledge
//!       of that specific opponent, appropriate when the opponent really is it.
//!   L1  freezes whatever buttons the opponent is currently holding.
//!
//! `mirror.js` is folded in here. JS built a getter-proxy view with tanks 0 and
//! 1 swapped so the agent could always call itself `tanks[0]`; Rust has no
//! cheap equivalent, so the sandbox takes `me` and reorders the tanks itself.
//! Same result, one fewer indirection. `Tank::number` is copied, not
//! renumbered, so events still carry real tank identities.
