//! Browser entry point.
//!
//! No `wasm-bindgen`: the surface is small enough that a C ABI plus one flat
//! `f32` buffer is simpler, has no build-tool dependency, and costs nothing at
//! the boundary. JS reads the buffer straight out of the wasm linear memory,
//! so a frame of render state crosses with zero serialisation.
//!
//! Because it is the same crate the training loop links, the browser and the
//! trainer run byte-identical physics. That is the whole reason for compiling
//! to wasm rather than keeping a second engine in JS.
